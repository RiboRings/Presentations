## Learning goals

-   Broaden view on accessibility
-   Learn tools for accessible data science
-   Make research outreach more accessible

## Prologue

While presenting my poster at Jyv√§skyl√§ Summer School...

## Accessibility

Over a billion people (more than 15% of the global population) have at least one disability [@world2022global].

The 2019 European Accessibility Act (EEA) just came into effect in June 2025 and requires EU products to be accessible.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (3WC) promote content to be:

-   **perceivable** to multiple senses (e.g., alt text)
-   **operable** in multiple modes (e.g., keyboard navigation)
-   **understandable** through a simple and intuitive interface
-   **robust** with current and future tech (e.g, reading machine)

## Multi-sensory visualisation

For more accessible data visualisation, we can leverage multiple sensory modalities.

## Beyond just plots

Accessibility from enthusiast to devoted:

-   Alternative text
-   Plots to sounds (sonification)
-   3D-printed models
-   Embossed paper
-   Lithophanes
-   Haptics

## Alt text

Alt text should not be a copy of the figure caption, as it serves a different purpose (accessibility vs context/emphasis).

Alt text should be a clear and complete description of visual content (e.g, a figure), going from general to narrow focus, from major to minor aspects.

![Example of alt text from my master thesis](img/alt_text.png)

## Sonify the microbiome

Any plot can be sonified, or at least that's what theory says... Here are some [microbiome sonification experiments](https://github.com/RiboRings/SonifyMicrobiome/tree/8c7cd6265ef2a7aad7ec04dcb46fc57a2b551857){target="_blank"} using:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Compositional barplots
-   Alpha diversity boxplots
-   Ordination plots
-   Phylogenetic trees üêò [@boutin2017sonification]

## Tactile paper

Paper with embossed Braille text and graphics. A special (expensive) paper and machine are required, but printing is easy and fast (seconds to minutes).

## Lithophanes

The rebirth of an old art as a method for data accessibility [@koone2022data].

## Haptics

Vibration, pressure, ultrasound, electric stimulation, or anything that can
mimic the experience of touch.

Create haptic feedback on [W3C Vibration API](https://www.w3.org/TR/vibration/){target="_blank"} or [HTML](http://diagramcenter.org/integrating-haptic-feedback.html){target="_blank"}.

## R toolkit 4 Ally

How can I make my tables and figures more accessible?

-   Data textualisation ([`BrailleR`](https://jooyoungseo.com/post/ds4blind/){target="_blank"})
-   Data sonification ([`sonify`](https://jooyoungseo.com/post/ds4blind/){target="_blank"})
-   Data tactualisation ([`tactileR`](https://jooyoungseo.com/post/ds4blind/){target="_blank"})
-   Every ggplotter's broken dream ([~~`playitbyr`~~](http://playitbyr.org/){target="_blank"}) ü§©üò≠

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# iris dataset vars mapped to pitch, time, modulation freq and index
sonify(iris, sonaes(time = Petal.Length, pitch = Petal.Width,
                    mod = Sepal.Length, indx = Sepal.Width)) +
  shape_scatter() +
  scale_time_continuous(c(0, 10)) +
  scale_pitch_continuous(c(7, 12))
```

## Epilogue

How to make my poster more accessible?

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
-   QR codes with alt text or sounds
-   Text and plots on tactile paper
-   Plots on lithophanes
-   3D-printed models of results
-   Haptics when touching plots
-   Get more creative
